<!-- SUMMARY-->
## Summary

The Sega Gun Sense Board 838-13143 is an arcade board developed by Sega in the 1990s to provide accurate aiming and shooting mechanics in light gun games. The board was first used in "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" arcade game in 1997, where it was paired with Sega's Type 2 (Type II) light gun.

Over the years, Sega released several revisions of the Gun Sense Board. The initial release was specific to "The Lost World: Jurassoc Park" and was designed for 12 sensors around the screen not 10 (which was the new standard on the later revisions - although these boards were backwards compatible. These boards can be found in games from the late 90s right up through the 2000s as the technology didn't fundementally change.

Overall, the Sega Gun Sense Board was a critical component in many popular light gun arcade games and contributed to the success of the genre during the 1990s and early 2000s.
